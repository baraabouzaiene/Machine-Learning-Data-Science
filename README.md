# Machine-Learning-Data-Science
This repository contains a collection of small projects and exercises to practice and showcase skills in **machine learning (ML)** and **data science (DS)**.  
The projects cover various aspects including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature engineering and handling missing values
- Building and evaluating ML models using Scikit-learn
- Comparing multiple classifiers and understanding their strengths/weaknesses

Each project is self-contained in its own folder with its corresponding Jupyter Notebook and, if small, dataset included.  

## Projects included (examples)
- Titanic Survival Prediction (Classification problem)
- [Future projects: Iris dataset, House Prices, MNIST, etc.]

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical ML and DS skills through hands-on projects that can be shared with recruiters or included in a portfolio.
